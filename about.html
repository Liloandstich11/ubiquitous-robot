<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>It's a pleasure to meet you! I am Jennifer and I was born in Nazca, Peru and raised in Munich, Germany.
A bit about myself: I'm a very curious person and love adventure, traveling, cooking, and listening to music.</p>

<p>I tend to spend my time either meditating, practicing yoga, or reading a book.
I have a strong passion for discovering new things and pushing my limits.</p>

<p>I am a person who is adaptable and flexible, but I also require my spiritual freedom.
  My current location is Brazil, but I always travel to Europe for a couple of months to visit my family and friends.</p>
